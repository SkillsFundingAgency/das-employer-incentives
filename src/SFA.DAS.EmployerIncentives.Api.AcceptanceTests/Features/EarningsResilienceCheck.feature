Feature: EarningsResilienceCheck
	In order to ensure that all employers are paid the incentive payment
	As a service owner
	I want to run a resilience check to identify and update any apprenticeships without earnings calculated

#  TODO : Needs fixing
#Scenario: Earnings Resilience Check is run
#	Given the earnings resilience check is requested
#	When there are apprenticeships that do not have earnings calculations
#	Then the earnings recalculation is triggered
